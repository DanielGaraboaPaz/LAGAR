LAGAR is the name of a python package to perform LAGrangian Analysis and Research of particle trajec-
tories using analytical and/or real flow fields. This package was developed at the Non-Linear Physics
Group in the University of Santiago the Compostela (USC), Spain by Angel Daniel Garaboa Paz and Prof.
Vicente Perez Mu√±uzuri,
This package is intended to solve the transport problem using a dynamical systems approach,
d r /dt = F ( r (t),t)
with initial conditions
r (t_0)= r _0.
